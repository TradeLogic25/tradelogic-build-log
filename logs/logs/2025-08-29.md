# 2025-08-29 — Reset + Git Setup

## Highlights
- Locked app to **Display Names ON** (consistent across formulas).
- Rebuilt `colPeriods` collection (Week, Month, Quarter, Year) with default.
- Wired `radKpiMode` (Rolling / To-date) → variable `varKpiMode`.
- Added global variable `varStartDT` for clean date filtering.
- Dropped debug label `lblDebug_Mode` to show Mode/Period/Start.
- Initialized Git locally and linked to GitHub repo with branch protection.

## Risks / Decisions
- Delegation warnings remain on aggregates (e.g., Sum) — acceptable for MVP.
- Branch protection requires using feature branches + pull requests.
- Standardized on **Display Names** (`'Closing Date'`, `'Created On'`, `'Status Reason'`, `Amount`).

## Next Steps
- Resume KPI wiring:
  1. Open Deals  
  2. Pipeline Value  
  3. Win Rate %  
  4. Cycle Time  
- Commit each KPI milestone in its own branch.
- Draft daily Git workflow cheat sheet for repeatable process.
