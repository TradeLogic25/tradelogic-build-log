# 📌 TradeLogic Build Log — 2025-09-07  

## Breakthroughs  
- ✅ Fixed blank/grey form issue by resetting form context properly.  
- ✅ Added correct `NewForm(frmProject)` call in `OnVisible` for ProjectFormScreen.  
- ✅ Project form now opens in New mode, allows text input, and saves without errors.  
- ✅ Deal form tested successfully — also creates new records cleanly.  

## Decisions / Fixes  
- Removed old GUID-based “Project Name” field → replaced with proper text column.  
- Adjusted **Default** on Project Name input to `Parent.Default`.  
- Set DataCard Default to `Blank()` to avoid record conflicts.  
- Ensured `New Project` button resets form:  

## Next Steps  
- Add confirmation/success notification after Submit.  
- Wire navigation back to Home after record creation.  
- Begin testing lookups (Accounts, Contacts) to confirm save behavior.
